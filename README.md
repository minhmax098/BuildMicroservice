# BuildMicroservice
Introduction: 
- Microservices is a solution that allows dividing a large system into several independent components for development, testing and deploying.
- Spring Cloud is a subproject in the Spring family, used to develop distributed applications. An application is called a Distributed application when its parts can be developed in different languages and deployed on different servers. Thus, 
- Spring Cloud was born to be a microservice system. All Spring Cloud projects should be created from Spring Boot to minimize complex configurations and make it easier to install.
- We will research how to build a microservice system using Spring Boot and Eureka (a project in Spring Cloud). The first part is to create microservices and gateways.

Overview: 
- We need to create registry services, images, galleries and a gateway. 
- The Gallery service will take the pictures taken from the Image service and organize them into a photo album.
- Spring Boot version that we will use, is 2.3.7.REALSE or 2.4.1
